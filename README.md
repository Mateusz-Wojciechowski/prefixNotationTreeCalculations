# prefixNotationTreeCalculations

Hello!

This program computes given prefix notation expressions using a tree.

When you run the programm a simple menu appears, it allows you to enter a few commands which i listed below:

enter {(prefix expression with spaces eg. * + 1 2 3)}, when given incorrect expression a quick fix is performed

print - prints the tree in both prefix notation and in form of a tree

vars - lists all variables presents in the tree eg. * + 1 2 a, "a" will be listed

comp {var1 var2, ..., varn}- computes expression given previously while replacing n variables (if they exist) with var1, ..., varn
